# Procedurally Generated, Environmentally Responsive Trees


### Project Summary:

Trees are a common feature used in game environments; however usually unresponsive and static. The contrast between the ever-changing shape of trees in real-life and stagnant pre-made models, highlights the false reality of games, therefore, disturbing player immersion. Dynamic trees, growing in real-time, according to their surrounding environmental factors, could be implemented to increase a game’s verisimilitude as well as player experience. In this project, two generative algorithms,  suitable for the creation of branching structures, were adapted to construct visually appealing and realistic tree models in real-time with minimal effects on performance. The algorithms were also adjusted to respond to their environment by shape and rate of growth alterations.

### Abstract:

Context: 
Trees are a common feature used in game environments; however usually unresponsive, and static. The contrast between the ever-changing shape of trees in real-life and stagnant pre-made models, highlights the false reality of games, therefore, disturbing player immersion. Dynamic trees, growing according to their surrounding environmental factors, could be implemented to increase a game’s verisimilitude as well as player experience.

Aim: 
The aim of this project is to explore and compare generative algorithms that can be used for the procedural generation of realistic, visually appealing, environmentally responsive trees, in real-time.

Method: 
Using C++ and the Unreal Engine, an application was constructed, featuring implementations of the space colonization and shortest path algorithms, to procedurally generate environmentally responsive tree structures. A virtual habitat with various environmental factors was developed to act as a setting for tree growth. Surrounding components such as the sun, wind, temperature and soil conditions were customizable and heavily influenced each algorithms finalised tree structures.

Results: 
The resulting trees were required to be responsive to the environment, realistic, visually appealing and to grow in real-time with a low performance impact. Therefore, the algorithms were compared and evaluated using quantitative and qualitative metrics such as performance calculations and visual realism. Both algorithms performed equally, with each algorithm being visually preferred depending on the surrounding environmental factors.

Conclusion: 
Although there is room for improvement concerning visual detail, environmental responsiveness and scalability, this project proved the possibility of applying procedurally generated, responsive trees to video game environments without having a high impact on performance.
